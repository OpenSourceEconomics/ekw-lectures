This repository contains several lectures that use the ``respy`` package to solve, simulate, and estimate Eckstein-Keane-Wolpin models. These support our educational activities around our group's research code. We provide an accompanying handout and presentation for this class of models `here <https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/ekw-promotion/tree/master/promotion>`_.
