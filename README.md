# respy-lecture

This repository contains several lectures that use the ``respy`` package.

## Robinson - Crusoe model

We outline the model that serves as the running example throughout the lectures.

## Maximum likelihood estimation

We estimate the Robinson-Crusoe economy using the method of maximum likelihood. We look at the profile likelihoods, study the distribution and linearity of the score statistic and function, and compare alternative methods to compute confidence bounds.
