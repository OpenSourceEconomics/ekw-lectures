# respy - lectures

This repository contains several lectures that use the ``respy`` package.

#### [Robinson Crusoe model](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/OpenSourceEconomics/respy-lectures/blob/master/lectures/00_robinson_economy/notebook.ipynb)

We outline the model that serves as the running example throughout the lectures.

#### [Maximum likelihood estimation](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/OpenSourceEconomics/respy-lectures/blob/master/lectures/01_maximum_likelihood/notebook.ipynb)

We estimate the Robinson-Crusoe economy using the method of maximum likelihood. We look at the profile likelihoods, study the distribution of the score statistic, linearity of the score function, and compare alternative methods to compute confidence bounds. Finally, we study the sensitivity of the analysis to numerical parameters.
