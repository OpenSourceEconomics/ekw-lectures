===================

This repository contains several lectures that use the ``respy`` package for the solution, simulation, and estimation of Eckstein-Keane-Wolpin (EKW) models. These support our educational activities around our group's research code. Please see the  `documentation <https://ekw-lectures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ for details.
